### Other language in search

Algolia search changed to [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/guides/getting_started.html).

lunr was not installed as a plugin, but as a file from [this](https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages/tree/master) repository. To change the search language, go to the repository, download the **lunr.your_language.js** file and save it to this path:

<pre>â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ search
</pre>

and replace your_language in **createIndex.js** (the file is in the search folder) file on line 25 and 30.If you want English, just comment out lines 22-25 and 30. If you want to use multiple languages, uncomment lines 24 and 25 and comment out line 30.

```js
22  var lunr = require('./lib/lunr.js');
23  require('./lunr.stemmer.support.js')(lunr);
24  // require('./lunr.multi.js')(lunr);
25  require('./lunr.ru.js')(lunr);
26
27  // Create lunr index
28  const index = lunr(function () {
29    // this.use(lunr.multiLanguage('en', 'ru'));
30    this.use(lunr.ru);
```
