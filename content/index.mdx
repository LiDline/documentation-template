# About .mdx Files

The project utilizes .mdx files.

These files should be placed in the content folder. Each .mdx file represents a separate page. The current page is located at **./content/index.mdx**.

The following custom components are currently implemented:

- h;
- p;
- pre;
- a;
- img;
- code;
- table;
- mermaid (diagrams);

All custom MDX components are sourced from **./src/components/mdxComponents/index.js**.
Additionally, other HTML and markdown components that are not listed in index.js can also be used.

The application supports various screen resolutions of phones.
